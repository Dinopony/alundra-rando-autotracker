# alundra-rando-autotracker

A Bizhawk script providing an automatic tracker for Alundra Randomizer.

In Bizhawk interface, go into "Tools" menu, then "Lua Console".
A window opens, click on the "Script" menu, then "Open script...", then select the `alundra_autotracker.lua` file.
Bear in mind that the `assets` folder containing the item images needs to stay along with the script.
